STATIC 
	Static members of a class are accessible without creating an object and are shared between all objects

NON-STATIC
	Non-Static members are created when an object is created. Each object has a different non-static member value. Non-static members are accessible only with the object.
Anyone can't access non-static members without an object name. These are not shared with another object.
